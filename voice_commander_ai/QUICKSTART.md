## Quick Commands to Try

Say these voice commands after starting the app:

- "Bye" → Exits the program

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone not working?
1. Check that microphone is connected
2. Test in Windows Settings → Sound → Input
3. Edit `config.py` and try different MICROPHONE_INDEX values

### "Could not understand audio"
1. Speak clearly and closer to microphone
2. Reduce background noise
3. Increase AMBIENT_NOISE_DURATION in `config.py`

### PyAudio installation fails?
```bash
# Try this on Windows
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio

# Or use conda
conda install pyaudio
```
