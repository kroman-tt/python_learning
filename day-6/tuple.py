# tuple is an immutable sequence type in Python that can store a collection of items.
# Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified after they are

# tuple_1 = (1, 2, 3, "kroman", 4.5)
# print(tuple_1) #created.
# # Tuples are defined using parentheses () and can contain elements of different data types, including
# tuple_1[2 ]= 16
# print(tuple_1) #integers, strings, floats, and even other tuples.
# Here are some key features of tuples:
# tuple_1.append(6)
# print(tuple_1) #1. Immutable: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.



# print(tuple_1[0]) #2. Ordered: Tuples maintain the order of elements, meaning that the order in which elements are added is preserved.

# print(tuple_1.count(1)) #3. Allow Duplicates: Tuples can contain duplicate elements.

#packing and unpaclking tuple
# my_tuple = (29,83,39)
# a,b,c = my_tuple #unpacking
# print(a)
# print(b)    
# print(c)


# packing tuple 
# a=23
# b=45
# c=67

# my_tuple = (a,b,c) #packing
# print(my_tuple)


# concatenation of tuple
# tuple_a = (1,2,3)
# tuple_b = (4,5,6)
# print(tuple_a + tuple_b)
